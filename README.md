# To-Do App

A simple Flutter application that allows users to manage their tasks with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app uses **BLoC** state management and **SQLite** for local storage.

## Features

- **Read Tasks**: View all tasks in a list.
- **Update a Task**: Edit task details (title/description).
- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by **completed** or **pending** status.

## Requirements
